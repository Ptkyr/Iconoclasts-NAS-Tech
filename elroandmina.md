# Elro and Mina

## Elro damage boosting

Elro normally moves ridiculously slowly. This can be mitigated by damage boosting to store your speed when you take knockback from a hit. You do this by turning opposite to whatever direction you want to go, and holding where you want to go when you get hit. This provides persistent speed similar to how a BB works, and saves a lot of time in the walk up to the Lawrence fight.

## Extending Minaâ€™s dashes

Mina can dash if you press `Down` and `Jump` on the ground. This is her fastest movement on flat ground, and the dash length can be extended if you do them off ledges, preserving the higher speed for longer.
