# Skips

## Kerthunk skip
Kerthunk skip abuses infinite wrench glitch to let you walk out of Mina’s dialogue right before the fight.

To get IWG, hold `Swap` into the cutscene trigger here, and without letting go of `Swap`, press and hold `Wrench` for a bit once Robin stops being pushed by the cutscene.
You should have a weird stuttering walk and when you go into the Kerthunk room, you will moonwalk out of the room once you reach Mina, then skip the cutscene when the Blockrock autosplit happens if you have that enabled.

## Fish jump 
Abusing a combination of killboosts, gunboosts, and swinging off bolts to gain massive height, reaching the room before Inti much sooner than intended and skipping a key. Saves about 30 seconds, and a second fish jump can be used in NAS to skip the Robots 2 fight as well.

Fastest and most consistent setup

The reroute if you plan to do fish jump twice

## Bat jump
Similar to fish jump, but skips basically all of Dark Cave and is a massive timesave.

Instead of using a bolt for more height, you do a big jump off a bat, killboost, then gunboost up to the ledge. To do so optimally, you begin executing the skip on the fourth bounce above the bat if you backboosted into the room.

There are two ways to do this skip, use whichever you are more comfortable with:
* Using stungun

* Using bombs + rockets

## White skip
Notorious for its difficulty and necessity for top times, White skip is a frame perfect trick that occurs when you leave the water room right before the actual fight on a specific frame, skipping it completely and saving upwards of 45 seconds.

The trick is consistent with only one frame and a very strict method, however loosely following the method may get you the skip anyways. Just keep in mind that the trick IS 100% consistent if you do it right.

To perform White skip, hold `Up` + `Left` into the upper leftmost corner of the water pool until Mina crushes White. When she does this, switch to holding only `Up`, `Jump` out immediately, and snipe the frame you need to get the skip on the FIRST PAUSE. If you have sniped the frame successfully, hold `Left` in the pause menu and unpause. If you paused too early, you can try to pause buffer more to reach the frame, but the skip is no longer guaranteed.

The trick is exponentially more difficult using this, but is the only consistent method found thus far.

Obviously, the frame you want changes depending on whether or not you have Fleetfoot equipped. Only the non-Fleetfloot frame is covered in this doc, as you can just easily lose Fleetfoot in the rooms before the skip.

The only consistent cue known for White skip is Mina’s position relative to the background. Using the harder method, her right hand must be two pixels away from the edge of the small square as shown. Her sprite changes depending on when you pause, so if you miss the frame you may have to adjust to a different one.

Note that you must be on the ground before moving left, but if you jumped out immediately, this shouldn’t be a problem. This is because Robin accelerates a couple frames faster on the ground than in the air, so it messes things up.

## Watchman 3 skip (W3 skip)
Another skip hated by every runner, also frame perfect like White skip, but with absolutely zero cues or consistent setups to get it. The execution is incredibly simple, as all you have to do is press `Up` on the same frame that the elevator normally stops before the fight.

There are no repercussions for going for this skip, but because it’s so random and saves so much time (~30s), it sucks to have to reset to it if you need the timesave to get a good run.

Here is a video of the skip → https://youtu.be/VKSlc5QBHQg?t=2209 

## Shit skip
An immensely important skip in Any% NAS, removing almost all lategame RNG from the run by skipping City One and One Concern East completely, saving ~15 minutes.

Performed by quantum leaping the One Concern West fast travel after defeating Black 1, gunboosting up, then stomping in the middle of the ring of controllers.

You will eventually land in a rocket platform with much dimmer lighting than usual and can go straight to fighting Black 2 → https://youtu.be/VKSlc5QBHQg?t=3429 

Important to note is that setting your grounded position here makes the skip much faster, because you end up higher after the leap.

This makes the execution slightly harder, but doesn’t mean much after a bit of practice.

Sometimes, through poor execution or just bad luck, you’ll hit the bottom of the black screen and begin falling repeatedly into it.

To reach the right side when this happens, gunboost up to get out of the falling state, then stomp and cancel it with Wrench during the falling animation; this will update your grounded position and make you fall in a different spot, but only works sometimes.

Repeat this until you reach the ring of controllers, then stomp like usual as shown here: 

![](Media/shitskipsaving.gif)

If you fail in cancelling any stomp when attempting this, the trick is still doable.

Eventually, you will land on top of this room after falling for a while:

To know when you land, listen carefully for the sound Robin makes when she stomps on the ground.

Once you land, mash Dodger to the right and you will end up where the skip normally sends you → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjlfZjWMZZM 
	
**NOTE:** do not mash random buttons while falling, just wait until you hear yourself land, then proceed to dodge right.

## Black 2 skip (B2 skip)
Black 2 skip completely removes the rocket fight, the ivory beast fight, and the brain fight from Any% NAS, most Low% categories, and all 100% categories. It saves upwards of two minutes, and is completely consistent due to a recent development by DLKurosh. If you would like a more in-depth explanation, refer to his guide (will hyperlink). 

In short, you download this [metronome](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537723651936485388/597935893218590740/Metronome.exe) and set a hotkey to start it at the same time you start a run. This lets you time an unpause for the skip, making it consistent as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfGN2UyxtpI&feature=youtu.be).

To perform the skip, you must jump into the top of the transition shown here which will zip you up due to the fact that the ceiling is actually at a different height between the two rooms.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/PJKl7lamr6ySXxPl406SsjTxDb4rVoZ27bCjASb_6024fUARtQcNfDdqKjx_-vMVTnWes9clCZ6VfuOXi_kNjins5P3RFvgJUgp11MCSnU9bgCAE4VIo_Dl-efdW6ZyD_w7xQP2P)

Important to note is that you will only zip if you enter the transition with some downwards momentum.

Three things can happen upon zipping:

* You get the skip and end up in the cutscene where you meet Royal in the rocket, then go straight to Midway after skipping it

![](Media/b2skipsuccess.gif)

* You end up in black space and have to hold Left for ~15 seconds to make it back into a room to try the skip again
  * This is obviously very slow, and was for a long time the reason you could lose so much time to the skip

![](Media/b2skipfail.gif)

* You fall under a different cutscene in the arena and softlock, meaning you have to close the game and try again
  * This is the least desirable option by far, but has always been completely avoidable
  * To avoid the softlock, just hold `Left` the instant you enter the transition. Holding nothing or Right will almost always give you the softlock.

## Impact skip
Similar to shit skip in that it involves a vertical quantum leap. You QL the transition into Impact with a very far right x-coordinate and skip all four arenas, stomping straight into the cutscene before the Nightmares segment and saving about a minute.

You should set your grounded position in the spot shown, generally just being as far right as possible in that room. Crawling makes you move slower, so doing that to find the correct spot is ideal. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HiNAbpL27BBTHqpLbVioZxksupHJZn5iiKWevA5fM0zUhKVqrC0HvRiD_wBJ-tjENE2Ix8rvFl4e58Wwo3DwQ0lyaj-qxTzprC4sXzXv1EAM6UEGTOvxgEYAS2LFuPwbbvDIBWDD)

A good cue to see if you have the right positioning is when you stand up, Robin’s eyes should be offscreen:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/A8e0iMcrgNsXTft43Ce2B3OsFAS9yBNnzTViqvQ47neRce5dgT4dI4gxGWsn-E6Q-n4M8WeK1HIA_5ziPOx2ukbHhmmt35994oPd12nRpWFyZfzXC1dtMEDGz8XUu16jt_e0ypPC)

From here, it’s some careful movement down to the transition, making sure not to touch the ground. If you know you might touch the ground, buffer a `Jump`. Buffered jumps do not reset your grounded position, and are safe to chain as long as you don’t mess up.
 
![](Media/impactskip.gif)
 
In the standard movement shown above, only one buffered `Jump` is required to make it down to the transition. Grabbing certain ledges can also help for lineups, and do not reset your grounded position as long as you don’t climb them.

Once you have successfully quantum leaped, the game will flash between black and white, so don’t stare straight at the game I suppose because that hurts to look at.

Right after leaping, mash stomp. Do not mash random buttons after stomping as this will most likely mess up the trick, similar to shit skip. After you stomp, it’s some waiting (~30s) until you hear the sound cue that means Robin has entered the cutscene before Nightmares. Skip that cutscene and you’re on your way to the end of the game.

Sometimes, you may land on top of the first Impact arena. This happens if your grounded position was too far left. The skip is easily doable if this happens, simply hold `Right` for 3-4s after the cutscene ends, and then stomp. The same waiting game ensues, then you skip the cutscene and end up in Nightmares → https://youtu.be/TaW8BlpQzP8?t=4308.
