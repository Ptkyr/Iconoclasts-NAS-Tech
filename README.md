# Iconoclasts Tech (No Airswim)

This is a document outlining almost all useful tech for speedrunning Iconoclasts. It does not contain any in depth explanations or applications of the Airswim glitch, but many NAS tricks are applicable to all categories.

## Miscellaneous Information
**Preloading**

Certain transitions take noticeably longer to load when you enter them for the first time after booting up the game, meaning you lose time through no fault of your own when you get to these spots in a run.

This contains save files next to the most significant known locations where preloading makes a difference: [Preload saves](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/537723651936485388/572120048530096148/preload.zip) (direct download)

Download and transfer each save file to your game, open them, and go through the transitions/cutscenes nearest where you spawn before starting runs for some free timesave over unloaded runs.

**Speed Values**
* Crawling - 230, 255, 280, 305 (Depends on Fleet Foot)
* Walking - 470, 520, 570, 620 (Depends on Fleet Foot)
* Wall jump - 500 (This boost stays indefinitely like most other things, slight improvement over walking)
* Gun boost - 600 (If done close to perfectly, otherwise drops off downward)
* Slope boost - 700
* Dodge roll - 1000 for startup, 650 until ground, then you reset to walk speed and decelerate ~400 units before getting back control. Interestingly this means dodger includes both the fastest and slowest speeds in it
* Swim - 200
* Fast swim - 350, slowish acceleration, not instant. Doesn't reach 350 with just one press, but starts decelerating immediately on reaching 350.

Some inconsistencies noticed from just eyeballing:
A slope boost is faster than walking even with 3 fleet foot
A gun boost is faster than walking even with 2 fleet foot
Wall jump is faster than base walk speed
Dodger isn't the same speed throughout the jump

For downwards movement, simply falling is always the best option as stomping has two slow animations, and you typically want to save charge shots for more useful things than upboosts.

Usurper has by far the shortest charge shot cooldown, followed by Stun Gun, then Roller Bomb. Hence, most movement is performed with the Stun Gun until it is replaced by Usurper.
