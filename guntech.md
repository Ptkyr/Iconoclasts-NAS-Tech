## Gunboosts

Shooting a charged shot downwards while in midair in order to gain much more height; acts as a pseudo doublejump.

## Backboosts
Shooting a charged shot in one lateral direction then quickly holding in the opposite direction to gain a persistent speed boost. Extremely common way to increase movement speed, and is typically performed while airborne since grounded deceleration is more potent.

## Crawlspace Backboosts
Essentially a BB while in a crawlspace, but much harder to pull off due to the increased deceleration from being on the ground the entire time.

Achieves the same speed a normal BB would.

## Upboosts
Shooting a charged shot upwards to quickly accelerate down. Can be cancelled by pressing `Wrench` much like stomp, and if `Wrench` is pressed very soon after shot release, there is no wrench animation.

Generally quite useless since there are far better uses for a charge shot, but has uses in places like Isilugar Depths for quickly accelerating into water, and for immediately going down to the bolt in every fast travel station.

## Acrid Shots
Releasing a charged shot in one direction and on the very next frame pressing a new direction.

Will shoot the charged shot in the initial direction, while providing a boost from the second direction.

Viable and used in really only one place RTA, namely breaking the rocks before Controller without losing your prior slope boost, saving ~1.25s.
